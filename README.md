# ElectricityRNN-Forecasting
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and other recurrent architectures for processing sequential data. Our primary focus is on electricity consumption data, a classic example of time series data that exhibits temporal dependencies.

Through this project, we aim to understand the intricacies of RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, and apply these powerful models to predict future electricity consumption based on historical data.

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned data scientist or a machine learning enthusiast, this repository offers valuable insights into the application of recurrent architectures to real-world time series data. Dive in to find detailed code, insightful visualizations, and comprehensive explanations!
